# Openscad
For 3D constructive solid geometry for 3D printing for fun and profit

This repo is for a dump of all my previous openscad projects. I have been using openscad when apporatie to design 3D objects for use in laboratory experiments. 

Most importantly I had a .scad file that would produce the .stl for our 3D printed burr hole covers in the gazmuri lab.

Other than that, this dump contains work done on a bluetooth controlled syringe pump, accelerometer holders and other fixturing, many other projects.

I have recently switched to using Fusion 360 (which has it's own cloud storage system) for my 3D designs.
